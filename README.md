# Wolf VR
Testing VR on GLTF loaded wolf asset

Demo at https://uwmiml.github.io/wolf-vr

If the model doesn't load when locally testing, copy the rigged-wolf.bin
file to the .serve directory as it is not auto-generated in there since
it is not referenced in the code for the module builder to produce.
